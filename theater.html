    <h1>Sudha Sravya does Chekov tonight</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>Ivanoff Act 2</h3>
    <h4>Anton Chekov</h4>
    <p class="direction">
        The drawing-room of LEBEDIEFFÃ•S house. In the centre is a door leading
        into a garden. Doors open out of the room to the right and left. The room
        is furnished with valuable old furniture, which is carefully protected by
        linen covers. The walls are hung with pictures. The room is lighted by
        candelabra. ZINAIDA is sitting on a sofa; the elderly guests are sitting
        in arm-chairs on either hand. The young guests are sitting about the room
        on small chairs. KOSICH, AVDOTIA NAZAROVNA, GEORGE, and others are playing
        cards in the background. GABRIEL is standing near the door on the right.
        The maid is passing sweetmeats about on a tray. During the entire act
        guests come and go from the garden, through the room, out of the door on
        the left, and back again. Enter MARTHA through the door on the right. She
        goes toward ZINAIDA.
